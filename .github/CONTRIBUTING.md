## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

#### How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem.

  - **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
  - **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Sanke, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Sanke otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.** For example, if you moved the cursor, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut.
  - **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines).
  - **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
  - **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
  - **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

### How Do I Contribute to the Wiki?

We aim to use the Wiki for documentation purposes. Thank you for taking your time to contribute with quality documentation.
Fo simple house keeping, we do have some guidelines that we kindly ask the community to comply with.

#### Documentation Requests From Maintainers

Every now and then the maintainers of the project, will create documentation issues. This can be caused by the lack of capacity, or simply the wish to collaborate with the community. Issues are tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and will surround concrete documentation needs. This is an open invitation for the community to contribute to the concrete piece of documentation. Project maintainers will always be referenced in the Sanke's [ReadMe file](https://github.com/Northern-Web/Sanke#maintainers).

Issues like these will be labeled as following:

- *documentation*
- *good first issue*

We kindly ask you to handle responses and documentation contributions through the GitHub issue tracker, within the Sanke repo.

#### Documentation Requests From The Community

Documentation requests from the community is always appreciated. The needs of additional or enhanced documentation can be addressed using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Northern-Web/Sanke/issues). We have no limits on how the community wish to raise an issue concerning documentation. For instance, any of the following cases could be applicable for you.

**You see a potential improvement in existing documentation**

- Feel free to open a new issue. Be sure to label it appropriately, for instance *documentation* and *enhancement*.
- Make sure to always link to the existing documentation, as a point of reference.
- Make your case about changes. Explain why the improvements are relevant.
- We encourage the community to write a suggested piece of improvement within the issue, opposed to simply point out the needs for improvement.

**You can not find any relevant documentation**

- Feel free to open a new issue. Be sure to label it appropriately, for instance *documentation* and *enhancement*.
- Explain the which parts of the project the documentation covers.
- Make your case about the additions. Explain why the additions are relevant.
- We encourage the community to write a suggested piece of improvement within the issue, opposed to simply point out the needs for improvement.
