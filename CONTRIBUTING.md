### Reporting Bugs


#### How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked using [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Sanke, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Sanke otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.** For example, if you moved the cursor, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
